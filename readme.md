[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) Bootstrap is an already-done Jekyll structure featuring:

## Requirements

Before anything, you have to install sass, compass and jekyll in order to work correctly.

```

```

## Usage

Just use this command to compile your website. (The output will be in ```_site```):

```
